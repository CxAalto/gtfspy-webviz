A live demo can be found here: [http://transportnetworks.cs.aalto.fi/webviz/](http://transportnetworks.cs.aalto.fi/webviz/).
See also [this video](https://youtu.be/JaDrBE45hro?t=19) showing how-to use the tool.


Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 3.5
- node & npm: https://nodejs.org/

An easy way to get things going with Python 3.5 is to use [conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):
```
conda create --name gtfspy-webviz python=3.5
source activate gtfspy-webviz
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
```

How-to
------
First import GTFS data using the gtfspy [Python package](https://github.com/CxAalto/gtfspy) into an SQLite directory stored on disk.
[An example how to do this.](https://github.com/CxAalto/gtfspy/blob/master/examples/example_import.py).

Change the `DB_DIR` variable in the `settings.py` file to point to the directory where you have stored the SQLite database.
If you have stored the database with another file ending than what is listed in the `settings.py`, please add the file ending to that list.

Run the following in the terminal:

  ```
  python run.py # starts the backend-development server
  npm start # starts the development environment
  ```

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. Enjoy.
